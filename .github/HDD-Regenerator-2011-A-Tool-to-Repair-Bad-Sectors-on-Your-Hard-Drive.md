If you have ever encountered problems with your hard drive, such as slow performance, errors, crashes, or data loss, you may have wondered if there is a way to fix it. One of the common causes of hard drive failure is bad sectors, which are physical damage or corruption on the disk surface that prevent data from being read or written.
