But how do you get access to Ansys 15 license software? There are different options depending on your needs and budget. In this article, we will explain the main licensing solutions that Ansys offers and how you can choose the best one for your projects.
 
## Ansys Licensing Solutions
 
Ansys offers two types of licensing solutions: concurrent licensing and elastic licensing[^1^].
 
### Concurrent Licensing
 
Concurrent licensing is the traditional way of using Ansys software. It allows you to purchase an annual or perpetual license for a specific product or bundle of products and use it on any supported MS Windows 64-bit machine. You can share your license with other users in your organization, as long as the number of concurrent users does not exceed the number of licenses you have.
 
Concurrent licensing is suitable for customers who use Ansys software frequently and consistently, and who need access to a wide range of products and features. You can also add high-performance computing (HPC) licenses to run parallel simulations and speed up your results.
 
### Elastic Licensing
 
Elastic licensing is a flexible, pay-per-use licensing model that enables usage-based licensing for software, computing power and Ansys Cloud hardware[^1^]. It complements and augments the value of concurrent licensing, removing access barriers like number of users, product access and HPC capacity.
 
Elastic licensing is ideal for customers who need occasional or sporadic access to Ansys software, or who want to try new products or features without committing to a long-term license. You can use elastic units (EUs) to pay for what you use, when you use it, either on-premises or in the cloud. You can also combine elastic licensing with concurrent licensing to optimize your costs and performance.
 
## How to Choose the Best Licensing Solution for You
 
The best licensing solution for you depends on several factors, such as:
 
- Your project scope and duration
- Your simulation needs and goals
- Your budget and resources
- Your preferred deployment method (on-premises or cloud)

To help you decide which licensing solution is best for you, you can use the Ansys Licensing Portal[^1^] to access all your Ansys entitlements and generate the licenses you need to run Ansys software. You can also contact an Ansys representative or an authorized channel partner to get expert advice and guidance.
 
## Conclusion
 
Ansys 15 license software is a powerful tool that can help you solve complex engineering problems and create innovative products and systems. However, you need to choose the right licensing solution that matches your needs and budget. By understanding the differences between concurrent licensing and elastic licensing, and by using the Ansys Licensing Portal or contacting an Ansys expert, you can find the best option for your projects.
